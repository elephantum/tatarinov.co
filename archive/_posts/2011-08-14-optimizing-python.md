title: Optimizing Python program
---

TL;DR
---

* If you want pure-python program go faster, use built-in
datatypes instead of inventing your own classes.
* Do not use pure-python for computationally-heavy tasks, you
will be penalized by emulation costs heavily, consider geterogenous
approach whenever possible.

Story of 32s &rarr; 7s Python program optimization
---

Some time ago I stumbled upon yet another programming language
performance meter: [gflarity/peg-performance][]. Though author insists
on maintaining exactly the same code style and technique, I would
disagree. Each instrument has it's own nuances in semantics and
runtime behavior, my point is that when used correctly Python is not
that different from Java/C even for such computationally-heavy
tasks.

Program we are going to optimize is a brute-force search for all
initial positions which can be solved in [peg solitaire][].

This is a post about optimizing [Python solution][] from 32s to 7s
(using my MacBook Pro as a test machine).

Initial speed test, w/o any modifications:

Interesting fact, [PyPy][] does not speed things up, contrary, makes
program go slower: CPython: 32s vs PyPy - 53s (perhaps I did something
wrong, I would appreciate demonstration of [PyPy][] greateness in
real-world example).

First, make things easier to work with in interactive mode and run under profiler.

Let's examine `legalMoves` function, we can see that it's body
consists mostly from loop with `possibleMoves` call inside. It would
be reasonable to start optimization with `possibleMoves`.

`Coordinate.possibleMoves` is a function which generate list of moves,
possible from this given position regardless occupied state. Function
itself is pretty simple, all it does is filling the list based on
`self.row` and `self.hole` properties.. Last word should be a hint to
optimization. Why? Because property is a function call:
`Coordinate.row` &rarr; `Coordinate.get_row()` &rarr; `self.row`,
function calls are not instant. Interpreter spends time to lookup
symbol, create stack frame, execute code, remove stack frame. While
one property call isn't that slow, but multiplied by million times it
can introduce measurable delay into execution.

Originally author introduced properties to make values read-only (by
specifying only read functions to property constructor). We trust
ourselves, and can drop strict read-only constraint, substituting it
to soft: we promise not to alter properties in runtime.

Change: [get rid of properties](https://github.com/elephantum/peg-performance/commit/e6e56c56a6a54d5ee66757b22c184405acb157ae)

A little bit better, but not enough. Another profiler run shows that
time distribution didn't change. Let's go further and eliminate `Move`
and `Coordinate` classes, substituting them to tuples.

Changes: [Move: class -> tuple](https://github.com/elephantum/peg-performance/commit/5d5c47dca432c19a04404a8093739d49132cfcdb) and [Coordinate: class -> tuple](https://github.com/elephantum/peg-performance/commit/d75bb91871c170dfa85ad0773d2f44f57fbbaa63)

Cut is so big because we eliminated `__eq__` which alone consumed 9
seconds.

Updated profile:

Drop in bunch of semantic adjustments. Changes:

And the last one, eliminate the rest of multi-step tuple
dereferencing. It helps, because there are additional costs for
executing each individual operation. By combining multiple operations
into one we save time on methods lookup, arguments parsing, results
wrapping. Each individual delay is puny, but repeated million times it
introduces significant portion of runtime. Change:
[one assign tuple dereference](https://github.com/elephantum/peg-performance/commit/274542629aabc96f21c5e014c9199967d92bbd72):

Conclusion
---

Classes while providing much greater flexibility
penalize performance heavily by providing several layers of
dereferencing. In order to avoid this penalty, it would be reasonable
to use tuples instead of classes in performance critical tasks.

Also, there is an unobvious, but dramatic difference between emulated
and built-in operations. Gathering several explicit operations into
one bulk, whenever possible, will help partially eliminate emulation
delays through relying on single built-in method call instead multiple
emulated operations.

It would be even wiser to avoid python for certain type of operations
and use C-extensions, Cython, whatever-else to implement
performance-critical parts of application. But this approach is out of
scope of this article.
